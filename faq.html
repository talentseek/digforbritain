                            Yes, the government has classified workers under ‘food and other necessary goods’ as key workers. This includes people involved in the production, processing, distribution, sale and delivery of food. This means as a key worker you are able to travel to and from work, and your children may still be able to attend their local school.

                            You need to discuss this with the farm you’re applying to. Workers can live on the farm or travel in daily depending on your particular circumstances and the farm’s situation.  All farms have good standards of accommodation which may be available to workers. They are usually permanent caravan style accommodation sleeping three or four people per unit. The charge for the accommodation is set at a maximum £52.85 per week for 2020, making it good value compared to private sector.
